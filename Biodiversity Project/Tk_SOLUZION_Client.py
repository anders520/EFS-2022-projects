"""Tk_SOLUZION_Client.py
 This file implements a simple "SOLUZION" client that
 permits a user ("problem solver") to explore a search tree
 for a suitably-formulated problem.  The user only has to
 input single-character commands to control the search.
 Output is purely textual, and thus the complexity of a
 graphical interface is avoided.

 This client runs standalone -- no server connection.
 It thus provides a bare-bones means of testing a problem
 formulation.

 Tk is the graphics and GUI Toolkit that ships with Python.
 This client program uses Tk only for its graphics, setting up
 a graphics window that is used for the display of each state
 of the problem-solution process.

 To take advantage of this, the problem formulation file should
 check to see if the global USE_TK_GRAPHICS is True, and if so, it
 should import a visualization file with a name similar to:
 Missionaries_Array_VIS_FOR_TK.py.

 One technical challenge in creating this client is that Tk graphics
 requires that the main execution thread be devoted to Tk,
 which means that a normal text-input loop cannot easily be
 sync'd with Tk.  The solution is to use a separate thread for
 the text loop and have it make calls re-draw the Tk graphic.
 Tk still runs the mainloop method in the main thread, which
 not only is there to handle any GUI events (but there are not any
 in this program) but also just to show the graphics window.
 If we don't call the mainloop method, the Tk graphic window
 will not show up until the rest of the program completely
 finishes, which is useless.  So there is a separate thread
 here for the user interaction loop.

 Status: Started on Aug. 2.
   Aug. 3. Basic array graphics is working. But now we
   need the strings and advanced options.
   
   Need example file Missionaries_Array_VIS_FOR_TK.py.
   Need code to display a color array, with defaults if anything
      is not provided.
   Need code to display a corresponding string array.
      consider options to include column headers, footers, and
      row titles on left and right.
   Add caption feature.
   The file for these features:  show_state_array.py

PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
        
    This module supports what we can call "interactive state
    space search".  Whereas traditional search algorithms in the
    context of artificial intelligence work completely automatically,
    this module lets the user make the moves.  It provides support
    to the user in terms of computing new states, displaying that
    portion of the state space that the user has embodied, and
    providing controls to permit the user to adapt the presentation
    to his or her needs.  This type of tool could ultimately be a
    powerful problem solving tool, useful in several different
    modes of use: interactive processing of individual objects,
    programming by demonstration (the path from the root to any
    other node in the state space represents a way of processing
    any object similar in structure to that of the root object.)
