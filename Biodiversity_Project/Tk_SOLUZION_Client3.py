"""Tk_SOLUZION_Client3.py
    Works with the example files
       Missionaries3.py
         and
       Missionaries3_VIS_FOR_TK3.py.

Differences from Tk_SOLUZION_Client.py:

1. Allows putting image file names in the array of colors
  that was used in show_state_array.py, and attempts to
  show the image, loading it into Tkinter if it has not already been
  loaded and converted to a PhotoImage object.
  (So in each element of the array of colors, you can either have
  a color, given as an rgb triple as before, or a string giving an image filename.)

2. Does not use the shell for user input. All user input is
  in the Tkinter GUI window.  But diagnostic info and the help message still
  comes to the shell.

3. Operators are applied by selecting them from a drop-down "combo" box
  and then clicking on the "Apply" button.

4. Does not require a separate file show_state_array.py
