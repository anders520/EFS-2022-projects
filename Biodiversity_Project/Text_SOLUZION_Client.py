"""Text_SOLUZION_Client.py
 This file implements a simple "SOLUZION" client that
 permits a user ("problem solver") to explore a search tree
 for a suitably-formulated problem.  The user only has to
 input single-character commands to control the search.
 Output is purely textual, and thus the complexity of a
 graphical interface is avoided.

 This client runs standalone -- no server connection.
 It thus provides a bare-bones means of testing a problem
 formulation.

Updated Sept. 2, to work from IDLE, with a fixed problem
 formulation (Missionaries). You can replace that name as needed
 for other problem formulations.
 
 Updated Sept. 1, 2020 to be compatible with the latest
version of Missionaries.py (Sept. 1, 2020 version).

PURPOSE OF THIS MODULE:
        
    This module supports what we can call "interactive state
    space search".  Whereas traditional search algorithms in the
    context of artificial intelligence work completely automatically,
    this module lets the user make the moves.  It provides support
    to the user in terms of computing new states, displaying that
    portion of the state space that the user has embodied, and
    providing controls to permit the user to adapt the presentation
    to his or her needs.  This type of tool could ultimately be a
    powerful problem solving tool, useful in several different
    modes of use: interactive processing of individual objects,
    programming by demonstration (the path from the root to any
    other node in the state space represents a way of processing
    any object similar in structure to that of the root object.)
